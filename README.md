# Two-Pixies
Personal project aming towards making an app to help storing information and helping my players to have a more visual experience on my TTRPG  

A few rules for organization:  
  we'll use the JS convention for readability here [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp]  
  but mainly:  
  -2 spaces for indent  
  -names shall be written in lowerCamelCase [Unless you're naming a component, in this case you'll use UpperCamelCase]  
  -Line Length < 80  

When you're going to do a commit, please use the format "type/brief message"  
also, commit frequently, mainly if you've switched tasks!  


for commit types, we'll use:

    feat: A new feature
    fix: A bug fix
    docs: Documentation only changes
    style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature e.g.: changing a var name
    perf: A code change that improves performance
    test: Adding missing tests
    chore: updating grunt tasks etc

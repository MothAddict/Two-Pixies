# Two-Pixies
Personal project aming towards making an app to help storing information and helping my players to have a more visual experience on my TTRPG  

A few rules for organization:  
  we'll use the JS convention for readability here [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp]  
  but mainly:  
  -2 spaces for indent  
  -names shall be written in lowerCamelCase [Unless you're naming a component, in this case you'll use UpperCamelCase]  
  -Line Length < 80
